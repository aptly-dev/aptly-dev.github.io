aptly task run
--------------

Command runs an aptly task, namely a sequence of atomic aptly commands within a single thread.

The commands are run sequentially. If one returns an error, the remaining commands in the queue will not run.

Usage:

    $  aptly task run <command1>, <command2>, ...

or:

    $  aptly task run
       > <command1>
       > <command2>
       > ...
       >

or:

    $ aptly task -filename="filename.txt"

The user can choose between three different ways to run an aptly task:

1. If multiple args are passed, aptly task run assumes it's a sequence of aptly commands separated by a coma ','
1. If no args are passed, then aptly task run assumes the use wants to input the commands manually falling into a kind of shell, where the user can type one command per line leaving a blank one when finished.
1. If the -filename="filename.txt" flag is set, `aptly task run` will run the commands contained in the text file. The commands must be written on separate lines.

Example:

    $ aptly task run repo create local, repo add local jenkins_1.575_all.deb, snapshot create snap1 from repo local, snapshot verify -architectures=amd64 snap1, publish snapshot -distribution=main -architectures=amd64 snap1, serve
